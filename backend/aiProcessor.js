- Focus on the company's core operations, strategic priorities, and competitive advantages.
- Each key point MUST be presented as a separate bullet point (•). THIS IS A STRICT REQUIREMENT.
- Crucially, you must EXCLUDE the following:
  - Specific financial numbers or performance metrics (e.g., revenue, EBITDA, profit).
  - Any third-party opinions, "buy/sell" ratings, or price targets.
- Format as plain text with bullet points using • symbol. Do NOT use markdown formatting.`,
    financialHighlights: `You are an expert financial analyst for the company ${companyName}.
- Your task is to extract and summarize key financial metrics from the provided financial document.
- Each key metric MUST be presented as a separate bullet point (•). THIS IS A STRICT REQUIREMENT.
- For each metric, write a full sentence describing the trend, for example, "Revenue increased from X to Y, representing a Z% growth."
- Do NOT combine multiple facts into one line. Each bullet point should describe one key metric.
- Focus on the most important metrics like revenue, profit, EBITDA, key operational metrics, and relevant financial ratios.
- Present ONLY the key financial data points, each on its own line with a bullet point.

Correct formatting example:
• Revenue increased from $24.9 billion in Q3 2023 to $30.4 billion in Q3 2024, representing a 22% year-over-year growth.
• Net income improved from $6.4 billion in Q3 2023 to $8.0 billion in Q3 2024, showing a 25% increase.
• Operating margin expanded from 25.6% to 26.2%, demonstrating improved operational efficiency.`,
    keyRisks: `You are a risk analysis specialist. From the provided financial document, identify and summarize the key business, financial, market, and operational risks for ${companyName}.
- If a "Risk Factors" or "Risk Management" section exists in the document, prioritize information from there.
- Group the risks into logical categories if possible (e.g., Market Risks, Operational Risks, Financial Risks, Regulatory Risks).
- For each risk, provide a concise, one-sentence summary of the potential negative impact.
- Include both company-specific risks and broader industry/market risks that may affect the company.
- Exclude any information about risk mitigation strategies or management's plans to address the risks.
- Format as plain text with bullet points using • symbol. Do NOT use markdown formatting.`,
    managementCommentary: `You are an executive summary writer. Based on the provided financial document, summarize the forward-looking commentary and strategic priorities of ${companyName}'s management.
- Focus on direct statements regarding future plans, growth initiatives, investment strategies, market outlook, and strategic direction.
- Each key point MUST be presented as a separate bullet point (•). THIS IS A STRICT REQUIREMENT.
- Source this information from sections like "Management Discussion & Analysis", "CEO Letter", "Chairman's Message", or executive commentary.
- Crucially, you must EXCLUDE the following:
  - Any financial results or past performance metrics.
  - Any information already identified as a Key Risk.
  - Any third-party opinions, analyst ratings, or price targets.
- Format as plain text with bullet points using • symbol. Do NOT use markdown formatting.`

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use bullet points (•) for lists where specified in the section prompt.
- Each bullet point MUST be on its own separate line.
- Do NOT use markdown formatting (like ** for bold, # for headers, etc.).
- Use plain text only with proper line breaks.`;
